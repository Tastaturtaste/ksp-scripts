## Python programs and scripts to fly my rockets
This project contains some scripts to fly my rocket in Kerbal Space Program and to test out control techniques.  
To interface with KSP kRPC is used, which allows the use of multiple supported languages. 
The latest tested configuration uses KSP 1.12.2.3167 and [kRPC: Remote Procedure Call Server v4.8](https://github.com/krpc/krpc/releases/tag/v0.4.8).  
To circumvent a bug with the connection logic, the setting to allow auto-connects of clients in the advanced server settings of the ingame kRPC server has to be enabled.
